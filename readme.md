# Autoconsent

This is a library of rules for navigating through common consent popups on the web. These rules
can be run in a Chrome extension, or in a Playwright-orchestrated headless browser. Using
these rules, opt-in and opt-out options can be selected automatically, without requiring
user-input.

## Using the library
Autoconsent is meant to be used in browser apps and extensions. [DuckDuckGo browser apps](https://duckduckgo.com/app) use this library to automatically handle cookie consent popups.

To integrate Autoconsent, you'll need to instantiate the main `AutoConsent` class in a content script (running in isolated page context), and implement some configuration hooks in a background script. See [this document](/api.md) for more details on internal APIs and data flows.

```javascript
import AutoConsent from '@duckduckgo/autoconsent'; // or '@duckduckgo/autoconsent/extra' for the version with filterlists
import { autoconsent } from '@duckduckgo/autoconsent/rules/rules.json';
import { consentomatic } from '@duckduckgo/autoconsent/rules/consentomatic.json'

const autoconsent = new AutoConsent(
    chrome.runtime.sendMessage, // provide a callback to send messages to the background script
    null, // optionally provide a config object here if you don't want to implement a background script
    { autoconsent, consentomatic },
);

// connect the message receiver callback to handle messages from the background script
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message) => {
  return Promise.resolve(consent.receiveMessageCallback(message));
});
```

In some environments (e.g. browser extensions), it's useful to access [eval snippet functions](./lib/eval-snippets.ts) directly in the background script. This can be done by importing the `evalSnippets` object from the library:

```javascript
import { evalSnippets } from '@duckduckgo/autoconsent';
```

## Browser extension

Autoconsent comes with a reference extension implementation. It is not published in stores since the feature is available in all [DuckDuckGo apps](https://duckduckgo.com/app), but you can build it yourself and use for testing.

To build the extension:

```bash
# Download dependencies
npm install
# Build the extension
npm run prepublish
```

The extension-specific code can be found in the `addon` directory. There are two versions of the
addon (found under `dist/addon` after building), one for `mv3` version for Chromium-based browsers, and a `firefox` version for Firefox.
You can load these in [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked)
in developer mode, and in [Firefox](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/)
as a temporary addon.

### Watch mode
For development, you can run in watch mode

```bash
npm run watch
```

This will rebuild the extension on every source file change. You still need to refresh the extension in the browser to see the changes.

## Rules

The library's functionality is implemented as a set of rules that define how to manage consent on
a subset of sites. These generally correspond to specific Consent Management Providers (CMPs)
that are installed on multiple sites. Each CMP ruleset defines:

 * If the site is using that CMP
 * If a popup is displayed
 * Steps to specify an 'opt-in' or 'opt-out' consent for the CMP.
 * Optionally, a test if the consent was correctly applied.

There are currently three ways of implementing a CMP:

 1. As a [JSON ruleset](./rules/autoconsent/), intepreted by the `AutoConsent` class.
 1. As a class implementing the `AutoCMP` interface. This enables more complex logic than the linear AutoConsent
 rulesets allow.
 3. As a [Consent-O-Matic](https://github.com/cavi-au/Consent-O-Matic) rule. The `ConsentOMaticCMP` class implements
 compability with rules written for the Consent-O-Matic extension.

## Intermediate rules

Sometimes the opt-out process requires actions that span across multiple pages or iframes. In this case it is necessary to define stages (each corresponding to a separate page context) as separate rulesets. Each one, except the very last stage, must be marked as intermediate using the `intermediate: true` flag. If the `intermediate` flag is not set correctly, autoconsent may report a successful opt-out even if it is not yet finished.

## Cosmetic rules

Some rules do not interact with the page, and only hide the cookie pop-ups with CSS. These rules are marked with the `cosmetic: true` flag. They are useful for pop-ups that do not provide a Reject button. Cosmetic rules can be disabled with the `enableCosmeticRules` config option.

### Filterlist
Autoconsent supports cosmetic filters in common ABP/uBO format. For performance reasons, it needs to be bundled at build time for performance reasons. At the moment we include cosmetic filters from [Easylist Cookie](https://github.com/easylist/easylist/tree/master/easylist_cookie).
Note that by default filterlist rules are not included, as this significantly increases the resulting bundle size. To use filterlist rules, you need to explicitly import the "extra" version of the library (`@duckduckgo/autoconsent/extra`), and set the `enableFilterlist` config option to `true`.

```javascript
// import the library version with bundled filterlist rules
import AutoConsent from '@duckduckgo/autoconsent/extra'

// ...

new AutoConsent({
  enableFilterlist: true,
  // other options
})

```



## Context filters

By default, rules will be executed in all top-level documents. Some rules are designed for specific contexts (e.g. only nested iframes, or only specific URLs). This can be configured in `runContext` field (see the syntax reference below).

## Rule Syntax Reference

An autoconsent CMP rule can be written as either:
 * a JSON file adhering to the `AutoConsentCMPRule` type.
 * a class implementing the `AutoCMP` interface, or
   * common JSON rules are available as reusable functions in [dom-actions.ts](/lib/dom-actions.ts). You can also use existing class-based rules as reference.

In most cases the JSON syntax should be sufficient, unless some complex non-linear logic is required, in which case a class is required.

Both JSON and class implementations have the following components:
 * `name` - to identify this CMP.
 * `detectCMP` - which determines if this CMP is included on the page.
 * `detectPopup` - which determines if a popup is being shown by the CMP.
 * `optOut` - a list of actions to do an 'opt-out' from the popup screen. i.e. denying all consents possible.
 * `optIn` - a list of actions for an 'opt-in' from the popup screen.
 * (optional) `prehideSelectors` - a list of CSS selectors to "pre-hide" early before detecting a CMP. This helps against flickering. Pre-hiding is done using CSS `opacity` and `z-index`, so be it should be used with care to prevent conflicts with the opt-out process.
 * (optional) `intermediate` - a boolean flag indicating that the ruleset is part of a multi-stage process, see the [Intermediate rules](#intermediate-rules) section. This is `false` by default.
 * (optional) `_metadata` - an object containing additional metadata about the rule. Metadata is lost during the build process, and is not used by the library in runtime.
 * (optional) `cosmetic` - a boolean flag indicating that the rule is purely cosmetic and does not affect the consent state. This is `false` by default.
 * (optional) `runContext` - an object describing when this rule should be tried:
   * `main` - boolean, set to `true` if the rule should be executed in top-level documents (default: `true`)
   * `frame` - boolean, set to `true` if the rule should be executed in nested frames (default: `false`)
   * `urlPattern` - string, specifies a regular expression that should match the page URL (default: empty)
 * (optional) `test` - a list of actions to verify a successful opt-out. This is currently only used in Playwright tests.


`detectCMP`, `detectPopup`, `optOut`, `optIn`, and `test` are defined as a set of checks or actions on the page. In the JSON syntax this is a list of `AutoConsentRuleStep` objects. For `detect` checks, we return true for the check if all steps return true. For opt in and out, we execute actions in order, exiting if one fails. The following checks/actions are supported:

### Element selectors

Many rules use `ElementSelector` to locate elements in a page. `ElementSelector` can be a string, or array of strings, which are used to locate elements as follows:
 - By default, strings are treated as [CSS Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_object_model/Locating_DOM_elements_using_selectors) via the `querySelector` API. e.g. `#reject-cookies` to find an element whose `id` is 'reject-cookies'.
 - Strings prefixed with `xpath/` are [Xpath](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath) selectors which can locate elements in the page via [`document.evaluate`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath/Introduction_to_using_XPath_in_JavaScript#document.evaluate). e.g. `xpath///*[@id="reject-cookies"]` can find an element whose `id` is 'reject-cookies'.
 - If an array of strings is given, the selectors are applied in array order, with the search scope constrained each time but the first match of the previous selector. e.g. `['#reject-cookies', 'button']` first looks for an element with `id="reject-cookies"`, then looks for a match for `button` _that is a descendant_ of that element. Compared to normal CSS selectors, this allows piercing shadow DOM and iframes:
   - If one of the selectors returns an element that has a non-null `shadowRoot` property (open shadow DOM), the next selector will run within that element's shadow DOM.
   - If one of the selectors returns an iframe element with a non-null `contentDocument` property (same-origin iframe), the next selector will run within that iframe's document.

 For example, consider the following DOM fragment:
 ```html
 <open-shadow-root-element>
  <button>X</button>
 </open-shadow-root-element>
 ```

Then `['open-shadow-root-element', 'button']` will find the button, but a usual CSS selector `'open-shadow-root-element button'` will not.

### Element exists

```javascript
{
  "exists": ElementSelector
}
```
Returns true if the given selector matches one or more elements.

### Element visible

```javascript
{
  "visible": ElementSelector,
  "check": "any" | "all" | "none"
}
```
Returns true if elements matched by ElementSelector are currently visible on the page. If `check` is `all` (default), every element must be visible. If `check` is `none`, no element should be visible. Visibility check is a CSS-based heuristic.

### Wait for element

```javascript
{
  "waitFor": ElementSelector,
  "timeout": 1000
}
```
Waits until `selector` exists in the page. After `timeout` ms the step fails.

### Wait for visibility

```javascript
{
  "waitForVisible": ElementSelector,
  "timeout": 1000,
  "check": "any" | "all" | "none"
}
```
Waits until element is visible in the page. After `timeout` ms the step fails.

### Click an element
```javascript
{
  "click": ElementSelector,
  "all": true | false,
}
```
Click on an element returned by `selector`. If `all` is `true`, all matching elements are clicked. If `all` is `false`, only the first returned value is clicked.

### Wait for then click
```javascript
{
  "waitForThenClick": ElementSelector,
  "timeout": 1000,
  "all": true | false
}
```
Combines `waitFor` and `click`.

### Unconditional wait
```javascript
{
  "wait": 1000,
}
```
Wait for the specified number of milliseconds.

### Hide
```javascript
{
  "hide": "CSS selector",
  "method": "display" | "opacity"
}
```
Hide the elements matched by the selectors. `method` defines how elements are hidden: "display" sets `display: none`, "opacity" sets `opacity: 0`. Method is "display" by default. Note that only a single string CSS selector is supported here, not an array.

### Cookie match
```javascript
{
  "cookieContains": "substring"
}
```
Checks if the substring is present in the document.cookie string.

### Eval

```javascript
{
  "eval": "SNIPPET_ID"
}
```
Evaluates a code snippet in the context of the page. The rule is considered successful if it *evaluates to a truthy value*. Snippets have to be explicitly defined in [snippets.ts](./lib/eval-snippets.ts).
Eval rules are not 100% reliable because they can be affected by the page scripts, or blocked by a CSP policy on the page. Therefore, they should only be used as a last resort when none of the other rules are sufficient.

### Conditionals

```javascript
{
  "if": { "exists": ElementSelector },
  "then": [
    { "click": ".button1" },
    { "click": ".button3" }
  ],
  "else": [
    { "click": ".button2" }
  ]
}
```

Allows to do conditional branching in JSON rules. The `if` section can contain either a "visible" or "exists" rule. Depending on the result of that rule, `then` or `else` sequences will be executed. `else` section is optional.
The "if" rule is considered successful as long as all rules inside the chosen branch are successful. The other branch, as well as the result of the condition itself, do not affect the result of the whole rule.

### Any

```javascript
{
  "any": [
    { "exists": ".button1" },
    { "exists": ".button2" }
  ]
}
```

Evaluates a list of steps in order. If any return true (success), then the step returns true. If all steps return false, the `any` step returns false.

### Negation

```javascript
{
  "negated": true | false
}
```

If `negated` is true, the result will be inverted. For example, `{ "exists": ".my-class", "negated": true }` will return true if `.my-class` does not exist.

### Optional actions

All rules can include the `"optional": true` to ignore failure.

## Manual Testing

To test the extension / addon with Firefox, open the `about:debugging`, navigate to "This Firefox" on the menu and under "Temporary Extensions" click on "Load Temporary Addon". Select the `manifest.json` file from the `dist/firefox` directory. You will need to build the extension before as described above. The extension should then be active and you can test it manually by simply visiting websites.
